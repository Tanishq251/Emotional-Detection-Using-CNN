# Emotional-Detection-Using-CNN

## Overview

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based system designed to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions. The system takes images of faces as input and predicts the emotion expressed by the person in the image.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection:** Identifies key emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of processing images in real-time for live emotion detection.
- **Pretrained Models:** Utilizes pretrained models to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated into existing systems or used as a standalone application.


### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
